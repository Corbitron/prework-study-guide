# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- I created the prework study guide as a way to help me study for my upcoming bootcamp, as well as to help others learning to code. 

- This project can be used as a sandbox to help myself and other bootcamp students sandbox ideas before class begins. 

- I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git/Git Bash.

## Usage

- Each section of the website contains topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Within each topic are notes going over the basics of the topic. Also, if you open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
